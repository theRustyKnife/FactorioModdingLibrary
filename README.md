# Work in progress
This project is in a very early alpha stage, more of a proof of concept. It is intended to be a library of useful functions for Factorio modders.   
I'll try to keep an up-to-date documentation on the wiki here, so you can go there to get an idea of what this is about. As of now however, it's not copmlete. I will also update this page to be more descriptive, it's just not a priority right now.   
The code is currently only on the ```0.1-dev``` branch as it's not very well tested and probably contains tons of bugs.

If any brave modder decides to try this out, please let me know how things go, if you like the concept and if you have any ideas on what to improve. Also don't forget to report any bugs or other issues. Thanks.
